# Online-Board-Game-Platform-Website-
Express+Node.js+Socket.io+MongoDB+React.js

This project aims to create a website that provides people a platform to play board games online.
However, this website has some requirements that it must be able to calculate players' rank ability and reputation credits.
Hence, registered players in this platform can have a general view of opponents' and their own rank abilities and start a match with people who own good reputation credits to improve players' gaming experience.

Personally, I start this project as my master degree final project and will write a report as my degree dissertation.
This web-based platform is created based on a preexisting website of which the source code address is attached below.
